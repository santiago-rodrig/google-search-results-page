# Google search results imitation
## What's this?
This is an HTML file that emulates the Google's search results page.
## How this was made?
With HTML and CSS, but most the job was made thanks to the developer tools.
### HTML
Did a basic HTML structure, then started to place everything for later styling it with CSS.
### CSS
Positioned every element according to the Google's search results page, and yes, I had to hardcode the results.
